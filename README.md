<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    This was a great learning experience, I had learnt how to effectively create a react app, install TailwindCSS and combine it with React.
    Although there was not much JavaScript and React with TailwindCSS may have been a bit overkill, I was happy with the practice.

    Alongside this, This is the first time I have used Grid for building responsive layouts, I aim to use Grid in future projects.

  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I am mostly happy with this project, despite not being pixel perfect. The interactive states for the project could be improved and potentially the overal
    visuals of each image (dark gradient background will likely do the trick).
