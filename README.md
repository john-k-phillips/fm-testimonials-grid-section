<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    Not a large project, so I didn't learn an awful lot; I did however, understand how grid area is used, when to use it and why it's powerful.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I will likely not come back to this project as I have gotten everything out of this (Learning Grid).
